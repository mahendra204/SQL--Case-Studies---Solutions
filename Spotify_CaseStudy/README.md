## spotify Case Study 
This case study is related to different users who installed and purchase app from different locations and different dates 
with different event of actions.

Depending up on the requirements of the client who need to know the details who have done the actions over the app or activity done 
by the users has been found by using SQL.

I solved all of the problems given by the client by writing different SQL Queries also optimized them of writing with different 
methods that you can see in my file as attached.
